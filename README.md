# django graphene authentication example - work in progress

In this repo, I'm trying to figure out how to do authentication and authorization with graphql and [graphene-django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django).

When I started, I was especially interested in mutation examples for user registration, account activation, login etc.

Coming from REST land, I heavily inherited from [drf-jwt](https://github.com/GetBlimp/django-rest-framework-jwt) and [djoser](https://github.com/sunscrapers/djoser).

Should anyone stumble upon this, I'd be very happy to receive some feedback.

I recently update this repo to work with `graphene>=2` (and without relay). The old `graphene<2` + relay version is in [this branch](https://github.com/creimers/graphene-auth-examples/tree/graphene-1/relay)

## what's inside.
* python3
* Django 1.11
* graphene
* docker-compose
* py.test

## mutations
- [x] register
- [x] activate account
- [x] login
- [x] reauthenticate
- [x] password reset
- [x] password reset confirm
- [ ] profile update
- [x] delete account

## main commands

### development
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose run django python ./src/manage.py migrate`
* `docker-compose run -p 8000:8000 django python ./src/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`
